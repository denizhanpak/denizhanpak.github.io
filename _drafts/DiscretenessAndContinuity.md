One of my favorite pieces of math is the unaccountability of the Reals. 
We can prove formally that there is no way to count all the numbers. The
first time I heard it, that didn't make any sense. It turns our even if
you lived infinitely long and spent every moment counting no matter how
fast, you could not count all the numbers. This piece of mathematics is,
in my opinion profound. It's implications are so much greater than 
numbers. It changed how I thought about the very nature of how our minds
and universe work. But to explain why it is such a big deal we have
to do some math. I will avoid jargon but not detail. Then I want to 
conclude what this proof can tell us about what it means to live in our
weird little universe. 

The process of doing math often inevitably starts with definitions. 
Let us first define what it means to count. To count we need two
things something to count and something to count with. The thing
we count with is usually the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... and the thing
we count can be all sorts of stuff from apples, to species, to grains
of sand, to scorned lovers. The process of counting involves taking one
of the numbers and assigning it to 1 and only 1 of the things we are trying
to count. Only the apple at the left most end of our box will be called 1. 
The next and only the next one will be called 2 and so on. We do this for
everything we want to count and voila we are counting. In the real world 
we count up to a finite number. In the world of math we assume if we have
a rule to do something we can do it infinitely. So imagine an infinitely
deep box of apples. We take the first apple out and call it 1. We take the
second apple out and call it 2 and so on. We have infinite time and in 
this perfect world we also have a social and economic system that allows
us to pursue our passions infinitely. I just really like counting apples.

Okay so now we know what counting is. We can count physical stuff but what
about idealized stuff. Let's count the natural numbers. 1 goes to one, 2 goes
to 2, 3 goes to 3 and so on.
