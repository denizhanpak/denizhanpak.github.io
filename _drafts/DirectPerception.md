Everyday you bet your life that you can step on that surface,
eat that food, see a car coming. You bet your life and in nearly 
every single case you are right. That is incredible. Anyone who
has made tried a hand at AI knows that's incredible. So why is
it that we can do that and yet we haven't been able to build 
machines that can too?

The problem comes from many directions and interacting norms and conventions.
Not too mention all sorts of political implications. But it can be stated simply.
We think there is a mind between perception and action. The world passes through
perception to the mind where a decision is made and a motor program is executed.
This is bad for serveral reasons. The passage of world through perception
loses accuracy and thus must be predicted. The decision making process must 
be fast and able to handle vast ammounts of data. The motor program must be
perfectly suited to deal with the fact that muscle activation is context 
dependent. The whole idea is precarious and expensive.

What makes people different? 


Descartes said that the seat of the soul is the Pineal Gland. It's funny how an idea can
look so different and yet say the exact same thing. The reason the soul needs a seat is 
because it is at the table with the body. How else is the soul supposed to control it's
puppet. How does the soul see the world? It receives from the pineal gland. The pineal
gland must tell the soul where the cars are, where the ground is, what makes that sound
and why it smell like shit. The pineal gland must recreate the world so that the soul can
make an informed decision. Replace the word pineal glad with any sensory system and the
word soul with any "decision-making" center and that is the dominant opinion of modern 
cognitive science. Mind is when one brain region recreates the world for another.

What we're good at and what we're not

One of the miracles of animal behavior is its adaptive relationship to it's environment. 
Behavior is fundamentally contextual. This achieved thought reliance on 

Of course modern neuroscience doesn't accept dualism. No scientist worth their salt
would believe that there is a non-physical thing interacting with a physical thing
to make physical things happen. There is no ghost in the machine, only electricity 
we haven't measured yet. If it is a ghost then science wouldn't work. Then where is
the decision.
