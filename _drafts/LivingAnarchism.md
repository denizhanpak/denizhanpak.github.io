Liv(ing)An(arch)ism is my version of a political framework/ideology. It is meant to be guide for
my own thoughts, accepting of my eccentricities. Smarter people than me have thought deeper than
I ever could:Bookchin (Murray and Deb), Ocalan, Kropotkin, Dewey, Foucault, Chomsky, Marx, Goldman,
Wrng Boys, de Cleyre, and many more. My hope with this view is not to improve the views of anyone
but to provide a frame of reference that makes sense to me and hopefully helpful for someone else.

Living as in
=============
the Living in LivAnism is meant to be a pointer to three commitments I believe are essential for
an ideology I want to embrace.

    1) Living as in Life: I study biocognition because I believe we have much to learn from the living world.
       for the vast majority of it's history our plant has been occuppied by organisms living together. Whether
       its organisms in an ecosystem, bees in a hive, cells in a body, or humans in society life lives 
       together. From life we may not be able to learn what the world should be but we can see clearly 
       all the ways it could be. In this case living means placing an emphasis that human politics is not
       seperate from Gaia but only a small part of it.

    2) Living as in Becoming: LivAnism is not meant to possess the rigidity of dogma. It is a living
       thought not a sacred stone. Living anarchism is born but it must grow and change. If it is useful
       it will bear fruit and pollenate new ideas. And when it's time has come it will die and leave a 
       fossil behind. 

    3) Living as in Praxis: Although I enjoyed the theoretical aspects of political philosophy, for me
       a useful ideology must be pragmatic. The goal of politics is not to study the world but to build a
       better one. Unless I live my beliefs through action they do not deserve to be called beliefs. 

Why Anarchism
=============
Anarchism is my favorite ideology (out of those I know of) for 3 reasons:
    1) Pluralism: There are many flavors of anarchism. Although united in their opposition to heirarchy
       the forms it takes are context specific and allow for the integration of new ideas. From anarcha-feminism
       to anarcho-communism, anarchism supports a diversity of thoughts and tactics.
    2) Integrative lens: Although many ideologies provide a coherent and useful worldview anarchism allows
       for a broad range of applications in a variety of contexts. However, in each context there is unity of
       method and ontology. The closest alternative with this level of unity is Marxism however that is 
       constrained by its reductionist commitments.
    3) Sufficiency: Anarchism does not provide us with the best possible world. Such a committment is at best
       optimistic and at worse misleading. Instead, anarchism expresses how the world could be better. In
       this way it is very biological sufficient rather than optimal outcomes. A world without heirarchy is
       exactly the world I think we can slowly strive toward.
