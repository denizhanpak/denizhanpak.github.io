Research Statement
==========================
A ball rolls down a hill. My dog runs down a hill. The ball bounces when it hits rock, completely changing
its trajectory. Levi on the other hand stumbles a bit but regains her balance, and if its big enough, she 
avoids the rock entirely. The world acts upon things. Life acts back. The distinction between being an 
object or a subject is one of the most foundational questions in human history. Why do somethings have
agency and other things don't? I am interested in trying to answer this question from a scientific 
perspective. What are the formal material properties that make up minds? To answer this question I look
at animals. Every animal is able to change its behavior to match its environment to continue to
survive. By looking building simulations of how animals behave I hope to contribute to a formal theory of
mind.

About Me
=========
I am a PhD student in Intelligent/Interactive Systems and Cognitive Science at Indiana University. 
My work focuses on the use of artificial intelligence as a modelling tool for cognition. I use the 
mathematical and computational tools from AI research to build hypothesise of how animal cognition 
develops. I test those hypothesise against the behavior of real animals to falsify them. I then use 
those results to build better AI tools and new hypothesise thus closing the Theory/Experiment loop 
that makes science so powerful.

I work in the Building a Mind Lab under my primary advisor Justin Wood. The specific AI tools
we are using currently are "curiosity-motivated" deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The animals we
compare them to are baby chicks raised in Virtual Reality chambers. VR allows us to build a virtual
world which is identical for both the animals and the AI models we compare them too. The advantage being
we can control for nearly all variables in both cases.
