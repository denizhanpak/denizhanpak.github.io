When friends or family ask what I study, depending on my mood, the answers can be neuroscience, cognitive science,
animal behavior, computational biology, artificial intelligence, and if I am feeling really frisky I'll combine two 
of them. To be fair though I don't think I am lying when I do that. However, there is a complete name for my
field of study: Computational Neuroethology. In this post I want to explain what those words mean and by the end 
you can let me know if I've been truthful.

A Study of the Mental
===============
Like most neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, and AI researchers, I am interested in minds. 
The problem is no one knows what a mind is. Philosophers have been working on this question 
for millennia and we still don't know when something has or does not have a mind. 
Scientists being a little too busy to care about a correct definition, have come up with 
their own definitions based on what they each find most interesting. 
Letting a thousand flowers bloom tends to work well, so I support it. Although, for any scientists
out there, it doesn't hurt to read some philosophy once in a while.

My definition of a mind is mainly inspired by the [Biology of Cognition or Santiago
School of Cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_theory_of_cognition). The basic idea is
that minds are a strange property that life has: "making its own decisions." This feature of life
is hard to pin down exactly but becomes most obvious when we look at how life manages to survive. Examples
include finding food, recognizing mom, avoiding rocks, and anything else where a living being takes actions
that help it live a little bit longer. Animals seem to be the easiest place to start (although bacteria are
looking pretty dope ngl).

A Science of Behavior
=========
The study of animal behavior has existed for a long time. Charles Darwin himself spent much of his time travelling
and examining how animals act. Ethology is the term used for the biological side of animal behavior research. 
Ethologists promote studying animals in natural habitats preforming autonomous behavior. This differentiates it from 
most other fields of animal research, where animals are in kept highly controlled environments solving very 
restricted problems. The ethological argument goes that animals evolved in their natural habitat to do what they 
do and to understand them we must observe them in that context.

Taking Behavior Seriously
==========================
One limitation of traditional ethology was that it remained descriptive. Much of the traditional study was
focused on building a library of behaviors rather than tackling what unified all of them. How behavior was 
coordinated was almost completely ignored. In response the field grew a new appendage. One which
added the toolkit of neuroscience. Neuroethology is a discipline concerned with the relationship between brain
and behavior. Neuroethologists not only study how an animal acts and moves but also what is going in the animal's
brain when that movement happens. In this way Neuroethologists provide a mechanistic description of how action and
perception together create behavior.

What about the Computers
===========================
Neuroethology is a small niche but one advantage of the label is its general lack of preconceived meaning. Computational
on the other hand means a lot to a lot of people. The computational component of Computational Neuroethology might best 
be understood in relation to computational physics. When quantifying phenomena in the world sometimes things get complicated.
In the world of physics when a physicist is curious about how a fluid flows they do not do the math by hand. They use 
a computer to simulate the many complex equations as they interact. This is the computation in computational neuroethology. 
Except rather than simulating particles I simulate brains, bodies and environments. I build video game worlds and 
populate it with virtual animal bodies connected to virtual brains. 
Luckily AI can serve as the virtual brain and robotics provides virtual bodies. I then compare how 
my virtual robot behaves to how the animal behaves. By doing this 
repeatedly and building different worlds and different brains
and different bodies I hope to contribute to a formal mathematical theory of mind.

Final Words
==================
In short, my day to day work is playing make believe with video game animals.
I am optimistic that it will lead to more than that though. Humans are part 
of the most complex system know to man. The ecosystem of Earth.
Humanity unlike any other species has an opportunity to improve the conditions 
of all living things on this planet. To fulfill that 
responsibility requires a radical rethinking of what it means to be human and what it means to be alive. 
That is what I hope my work accomplishes.
