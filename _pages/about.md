Research Statement
==========================
A ball rolls down a hill. My dog runs. The ball bounces when it 
hits a rock and rolls the 
other way. Levi stumbles but regains her balance. 
If the rock is big enough, she jumps off it to gain momentum.
The world acts upon things. 
Life acts back.
I am 
interested in understanding that difference. To that end, I build 
mathematical/computational models of animal behavior. 

My work focuses on the use of artificial intelligence as models for cognition. I use
mathematical and computational AI as hypothesise of how animals think and learn. 
I test those hypothesise against the behavior of real animals to falsify them. I then use 
those results to build new hypothesise thus closing the Theory/Experiment loop
that we think makes science work.

About Me
=========
I am a PhD student in Intelligent/Interactive Systems and Cognitive Science at Indiana University. 
I work in the Building a Mind Lab under my primary advisor Justin Wood. A major part of my research is 
on imprinting in chicks. Imprinting is a well-studied early emerging behavior which makes a great model
for studying learning. Our lab has access to Virtual Reality chambers for the chicks which allow us to get
exact measurements and collect high precision data.
Since I am interested in comparative work, I pursue other projects
ranging from other animals to theoretically abstracted toy examples of behavior. 

I have no other interests and spend all my time exclusively on academic thought (please hire me).
