Chapter 1: Introduction
======================

For as long as I could remember I have lived 32 seconds ahead. It's not that much. There were times when I
wished it was minutes, hours, when my dad died I wished it were years. Wishing doesn't change things.
Most of the time I wish I lived like everyone else. 32 seconds isn't much but it's longer than you'd think. 
It took me a while to come to terms with it, to deal with other people. Stop, take a breath. They need to catch up. 
Even then living ahead is just a little too hard. It's hard to explain what it means. 
People would give me a weird looks when I completed their sentences just a little too early. 
I've tried telling friends, partners, one night stands. 
The concept's a bit confusing. It's not that I can see the future exactly but that gets close enough.
Try telling someone and the best they could they do is ask 
if you can "guess the number" they were thinking of. It's a neat parlor trick though, makes for a good
pick-up line. Even then its hard to last with someone when you're not on the same time. Long distance in 
space is hard, long distance in time is almost impossible.

Chapter 3: Growing Up
======================

...
Ashley had these big brown eyes that I could get lost in. We were friends for
years before I was ready to tell her the truth. I planned it out. The timing would be perfect. This was 
my chance to tell her how I felt. I walked up to her at her locker. 
"I have to tell you something. I think you're amazing, you're funny, clever, thoughtful. I light up when 
you enter a room and I 
get sad when you leave. I've liked you ever since we met." Still have the paper I wrote it out on. 
32 seconds though was a little too much. After her brief hesitation she was about to tell me her crush
had already asked her out. I walked away before she could finish the sentence. I was still a child. We didn't
talk after that. Sometimes I wonder if I lived further ahead would I have heard something different. Would
I have been different? 

...

When my dad died I was 14. I was at home with my mom. The phone rang. What makes my condition different from
just seeing the future is that my experience is integrated. I don't just flash forward. I feel it all. Every 
second between now and what will be, happens at once constantly. She picked it up and she was about to cry. By 
the time her tears came out I knew what happened and it hurt. It hurt worse than anything had ever hurt before.
He was a good dad. He was a great dad and still the world took him away. The hardest part was at the halfway mark.
I knew he was dead and my mom hadn't said a word yet. The feeling of loss hadn't hit. I knew it would. I 
experienced it but it would need to keep happening for another 31 seconds. The moment of horror and pain over and
over. 32 seconds sometimes feels like a lifetime. I thought if it was longer if I lived in years instead, then maybe
I could've been okay with it. Maybe I could've known what it would be like to be okay sooner. Maybe I could've stopped
it from ever happening. That's what I told myself but I knew, I've known for a while that just because I was living 
ahead didn't mean I could change the future.

Chapter 5: The Smart Kid
==========================
...
I figured out pretty early on free will was a lie. The universe always unfolded exactly how
I knew it would. I didn't make any choices. I knew exactly what words I would say 32
seconds from now and as the words left my mouth I knew what the person would say after. Conversations
used to be boring but I learned that the 33rd second was where things got interesting. At the edge of
my knowledge the treasure of potential was buried. As the years went by the treasure got further and further 
away. 32 seconds of knowledge is enough for a 
life time when it starts to stack up. I could learn in half time because I always knew what I needed to 
know. The experience may have been those seconds but if you see far enough ahead things tend to follow a fixed
path. Surprise is rarer for me now but I am not perfect. Thank God.

Chapter 7: Picking a Career
=============================

It was unsurprising I would become a writer. I would know the ending by the time I started. I was
productive and writing was a way to live out all my fantasies. I would create characters who lived on their 
own time. Like me they could be different. The world of fiction was under my control unlike everything around 
me, unlike everything about me. 

...

Books were the best. A film was too predictable and the pacing was 
constraining. With a book I could pick the time. I learned to read slow, savoring every second. 32 seconds ahead
could mean less than a page. I could read a book and still be surprised. ...

Chapter 12: A Life Lived
=================================
...
How can you live in the moment if the moment you live is already gone? I used to hate it when people said that shit.
"Fuck you, I can't!" I've mellowed out over the years. I think I get what it means now. Although, it is still a stupid
phrase. It's not about the moment. There are no moments. There is only the constant stream of being and it flows like
water not like frames of moments. But moments aren't what the phrase is about. Living in the moment is about that constant
battle between the way things are and the way we wish they were. I fantasized a lot about that 33rd second, about how life could
look after I know what it will. But that 33rd second isn't real yet. Its the possibility of what could be but it is those 32
seconds of being that define what is. It is in those 32 seconds that I am. And it is okay to just be. So dear reader I hope 
you are and I wish you continue to become. As I say goodbye I only feel 30 seconds 29, 28, ...
