Research Statement
==========================
A ball rolls down a hill. My dog runs down a hill. The ball bounces when it hits a rock and turns the 
other way. Levi on the other hand stumbles a bit but regains her balance, and if its big enough, she 
avoids the rock entirely. The world acts upon things. Life acts back. I am interested in how life 
acts back. Why is it that my dog has a choice but the ball doesn't?
I am interested in trying to answer this question from a scientific perspective. Much like modern
physics is a collection of mathematical tools to study the laws of the universe I want to contribute
to the collection of the mathematical laws of life.

About Me
=========
I am a PhD student in Intelligent/Interactive Systems and Cognitive Science at Indiana University. 
My work focuses on the use of artificial intelligence as models for cognition. I use the 
mathematical and computational tools from AI research to build hypothesise of how animal think and learn. 
I test those hypothesise against the behavior of real animals to falsify them. I then use 
those results to build new hypothesise thus closing the Theory/Experiment loop 
that makes science so powerful.

I work in the Building a Mind Lab under my primary advisor Justin Wood. The main thrust of my work focuses
on imprinting in chicks. Imprinting is a well-studied early emerging behavior which makes a suitable model
for studying learning. Our lab has access to Virtual Reality chambers for the chicks which allow us to get
exact measurements and collect high quality data.
Since I am interested in comparative work, I pursue other projects
ranging from other animals to theoretically abstracted toy examples of behavior. 
In all my work I rely on computational and mathematical modelling to ask quantitative questions about how 
minds work.
