Living Anarchism
===========
I want Living anarchism to be a utopian ideological framework. for myself to make sense of
my idea of politics and it's relationship to my understanding of life,
morality, and meaning. It is not intended as an ideology to be spread or
accepted but rather a set of tools one can rely on to inform their thinking
on specific topics as they relate to their experience. The primary goal is
to develop an ideology dedicated to an understanding of what utopia looks 
like and how we get there. 

The Name
============
Living Anarchism is called such because it is meant to place an emphasis on
the two topics that have dominated my thinking over the last few years of my
life. Living in that it refers to both the scientific conception of life but
also living in that refers to the act of living out one's ideals. Anarchism
because I personally believe an opposition to hierarchy to be the most foundational
and useful lens for informing my own political beliefs. Thus as an ideological framework
Living Anarchism is deeply influenced by the study of life as well as the history and
development of the Anarchist spectrum of ideology which includes both traditional anarchist
frameworks as well as the many predecessors and successors that have been developed by a 
whole range of thinkers.

As an ideology Living Anarchism consists of tenants and principals. Tenants dictate considerations
that should be taken into account in all applications. Principals provide examples of how to proceed
they can and should change over time as a function of the various contexts for both scientific 
knowledge and the kind of problem attempting to be solved. 

Tenets
===========
Tenets serve as axioms for the ideology. I will try my best to make logical and derivable claims.
Thus I will heavily rely on both biological and mathematical metaphors. 

1. The maximization of autonomy: as defined as the ability of an organism to shape it's environment.
Is the intention of the ideology. 

The tenants of Living Anarchism are meant to reflect the symmetries between anarchist thought
and its connection to act of Living understood both scientifically and philosophically.

1. A Normative Framework: In the same way that we understand living to define a normative function
(link to other post) this framework also applies a normative lens. There are right and wrong actions.
The nature of right and wrong in this case is defined by the reliance on the foundational anarchist
value system. I take that autonomy is intrinsically valuable and desirable. Therefore violations of
autonomy must be justified through synergistic relations between the entity and it's constraints.
Living Anarchism takes for granted autonomy is good and seeks to find ways to increase autonomy
of all life (that which can be autonomous). Although it will be probably be a primarily human
driven ideology meant for human social institutions and structures Living Anarchism is dedicated
to a world-view in which humans are part of the greater living world and life as a whole is the 
carrier of value as opposed to purely human desires and goals. The primary goal of Living Anarchism
is to create a sustainable world where all living things of all forms can thrive in their own autonomy.

2. Self-Creating: Living Anarchism does not exist as an isolated ideology which is substrate 
independent (link to other post). It is first and foremost an ideology of action and praxis. 
It is living in that it is through active lived experienced of its adherents that allows it
to persist. When it no longer serving the function of informing action it has died and only
in service of its normative goals will it continue to persist.

3. Evolutionary: Living Anarchism follows the paradigm of evolutionary change. Evolutionary
change is generally defined by two foundational principles: variation and selection. Living
Anarchism is variational in that it is in constant flux. Since it is defined by the living
activities of it's adherents variation in the behavior of the adherents is a variation in the
nature of the ideology. It will be different for different people in different contexts and with
each context new ideas will be available. This allows for the ideology to vary over time. Selection
is defined through the landscape of normative function. New ideas will be tested to increase autonomy
but if they do not meet this goal they should be discarded. For myself not a single idea here is set
in stone with the exception of the commitment to autonomy. Any act, tenant, or argument should 
be recognized as being in flux and willingness for ideas to go extinct. This is a crucial aspect 
of the ideology.

4. Situated: Like all organisms Living Anarchism exists in an environment. It is not possible to
talk about or discuss Living Anarchism independent of material conditions of its surroundings. 
Adherents must adapt the tenants and conditions of Living Anarchism to the environment they find 
themselves in. Hierarchy takes many shapes and forms and opposition to hierarchy must do the same.
The Living Anarchist's solution to any problem must rely on the specific environmental conditions
for the specific issue at hand. Living organisms are adapted to their environment not to a general
set of problems but to the niche they live in. Living Anarchism must rely on the same fundamental
principle.

5. Embodied: Living Anarchism is embodied. It is embodied in this text, in my own actions and the
actions and artifacts left by those that have interacted with these ideas. No single text or person
is Living Anarchism; it is all of it. It's embodiment also means it exists as an interactive
entity. In addition to being embodied in these structures this also means it is limited. It can
only exist as long as such structures allow it to do so. Living Anarchism must be lived. It must
be enacted to be what it is.

6. Dynamic: Living Anarchism is dynamical. It changes over time. It is not, it becomes. Much like
life is not defined by a specific set of atoms or particles but rather is a process that such 
structures participate in (link to other post), Living Anarchism is a process. It is in constant
flux and never a singular static entity.

7. Pluralistic: Life has it's "many forms, most beautiful." So does Living Anarchism. It is not
a singular ideal with a singular way of doing things. It spans many species and many individuals.
It does not exist as an isolated proper ideology. It should be understood in conjunction with the
ideas relevant to a specific context at a specific time. Living Anarchism is not exclusionary of
other ideas and instead it functions along with and even inspired by contradictions between itself 
and other ideologies. There is no right Living Anarchism there are simply solutions good enough for
a given context never perfect but always open to improvement.

8. Ecological: Living Anarchists understand that Living Anarchism is meant not to subsume other 
ideas but to fill an open niche. It serves to highlight and unify when appropriate or to compete
and replace when necessary. Living Anarchism exists in the ecological context and should be adapted
and utilized by it's adherents as necessary to fill ecological roles that are missing or underutilized.
When appropriate it's ecological role may be to be disappear. It will cooperate with some ideas and 
compete with others. It's ecological role must be recognized in any and all of it's applications.

9. Biological: Almost any problem faced by a human has probably been solved by life. Living Anarchists
look to other species, not only our close cousins like apes or mammals but to bacteria for how to group
together, to plants for how to build infrastructure, to fungi to learn to communicate, to fish for guerilla
warfare. For the many problems that face those fighting for a better world Living Anarchists first look to
the living world to find the kinds of solutions that work and those that don't. Nature has always been more
creative than any human and Living Anarchists recognize and embrace that fact.

10. Naturalist: Living Anarchism takes a materialist worldview. Change only happens by changing the
material conditions around us. However, Living Anarchism is non-reductionist. Material change happens 
and can be understood at many levels of abstraction. Economic analysis is absolutely necessary however
it is not sufficient. The many forms of hierarchy can take must each have their own set of analytic tools.
It is the synergistic use of these forms of abstraction across different contexts that allows for
the material conditions that need to be changed to be understood. Living anarchists use a range of sociological
lenses ranging from critical theory, to feminism, to Marxism, to social ecology, to racial justice, to 
environmentalism, to queer theory, to inform and direct the movements toward change.

11. Developmental: Over the course of it's lifetime an organism takes many shapes and forms. The transition
between forms are defined by a range of milestones and cues. Living Anarchism relies on this principle. The
mechanisms for the first few days of organizing a movement may be different than the mechanism for defending
an established movement. Living Anarchists utilize this aspect of biological reality. They understand that 
no movement is the same not only across different movements but also across different days. Thus goals and
mechanism must develop over the course of a movement.

12. Robust: A key to the success of life is it's reliance on multiple interacting mechanism (link to other post).
Living Anarchist emphasize the building of systems that are robust to perturbation. Institutions and structures
built by Living Anarchists will serve to not only to out-compete their authoritarian or capitalist alternatives 
but also should be sufficiently self sufficient and robust that even after the individuals who make up
the organisation changes the system can continue to function with its own autonomy.

13. Self-Organizing: Living Anarchism recognizes that one of the key features of biological entities that allow
them to persist is their self organization. Organisms can behave without controllers. Cells can specialize without
being told what to do. This property emerges for systems with tractable rules for individuals that prevent the
need for top down direction and control. Living Anarchism looks for ways to utilize this property in organizing
by de-centering top down control and instead creating systems of distributed responsibility. From biological 
theory we understand that the creation of self-organizing structure is dependent on designing systems so that
the path of least resistance is the optimal outcome. Through practice, observation, and willingness to change
Living Anarchism advocates for making this property fundamental to its project of building a better world.

14. Analytical: The above tenants emphasize the pragmatic aspects of Living Anarchism however it is equally
important that this ideas are constantly re-evaluated and re-contextualized. It Living Anarchists who will
propagate and participate in building a sustainable ecological world free of hierarchy. Therefore it is
up to Living Anarchists to analyze and interpret existing movements and systems and to evaluate which should
be incorporated and what should be changed. The building of a better theoretical framework is foundational
to the optimality of praxis.

In the future I would like to discuss more concrete examples for myself to provide a set of examples of how
Living Anarchism may contribute to the struggle for a better world.
