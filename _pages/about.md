Research Statement
==========================
A ball rolls down a hill. My dog runs down a hill. The ball bounces when it hits rock, completely changing
its trajectory. Levi on the other hand stumbles a bit but regains her balance, and if its big enough, she 
avoids the rock entirely. In one case there is a system acting on a simple object with a manageable set of
forces. In the case of my dog, she's a bit more complicated. The wind in her hair, the ground beneath her 
feet, the muscles in her legs, and the neurons in her brain, are all part of her run. For the first case 
we have a formal mathematical theory describing how a ball rolls. For Levi we don't. My research interest
is in that gap. I am interested in building theories of how brains, bodies, and environments interact to
create adaptive behavior.

About Me
=========
I am a PhD student in Intelligent/Interactive Systems at Indiana University. My work focuses on the use
of artificial intelligence as a modelling tool for cognition. I use the mathematical and
computational tools from AI research to build hypothesise of how animal cognition develops. I test those 
hypothesise against the behavior of real animals to falsify them. I then use those results to build
better AI tools and hypothesise thus closing the Theory/Experiment loop that makes science so powerful.

I work in the Building a Mind Lab under my primary advisor Justin Wood. The specific AI tools
we are using currently are "curiosity-motivated" deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The animals we
compare them to are baby chicks raised in Virtual Reality (VR) chambers. VR allows us to build a virtual
world which is identical for both the animals and the AI models we compare them too. The advantage being
we can control for nearly all variables in both cases.

Before starting my PhD I was pursuing an MS in Computational Linguistics at Indiana University. During
this time I worked on various projects such as morpheme detection, sentiment analysis, topological data analysis,
word embeddings, and web design.

I did my undergraduate in Mathematics and Computer Science my concentration was on Algebra and AI respectively.
Although I didn't pursue a graduate degree in mathematics I am still deeply interested in the intersection
between mathematics and cognition. Much of my work is about using advanced mathematical tools to understand
systems which have historically been too complex to approach with traditional approaches.
