Research Statement
==========================
A ball rolls down a hill. My dog runs. The ball bounces when it 
hits a rock and rolls the 
other way. Levi stumbles but regains her balance without changing direction. 
If the rock is big enough, she jumps off it to gain momentum.
The world acts upon things. 
Life acts back.
I try to understand that difference using
mathematical/computational models of animal behavior. 

About Me
=========
I am a PhD student in Intelligent/Interactive Systems and Cognitive Science at Indiana University. 
I work in the Computational Neuroethology under my primary advisor Randall Beer. My work
focuses on developing mathematical theories to better understand the mechanisms of adaptive behavior.
