One of the most important advances in physics was the development of mathematics for 
describing the world. Experiments are useful but science needs more than a list of
facts. The results of experiments must be connected. My advisor Dr. Justin Wood has suggested
the term *glue science* to describe how experiments should be unified by an underlying theory.
The purpose of theory is to provide a narrative of the world which satisfies the question of 
why things happen the way they do. Not just any narrative though, a narrative which can predict
the outcome of every experiment done and predicts results for experiments that haven't happened 
yet. This requirement turns out to be quite strict, such a narrative can't be written in words 
since words are too vague and have multiple interpretations. The language most suited to this
task is mathematics.

Linguistic Limits
====================
Whether written as an equation or in computer code, mathematics is the language of commitment.
