For as long as he could remember he lived 32 seconds ahead. It wasn't much. There were times when he
wished it was minutes, hours, when his dad died he washed it were years. No matter what he wished 
though he knew it wouldn't change. Most of the time he wished he lived the same as everyone else. 32
seconds isn't much but it's longer than you'd think. It took him a while to come to terms with it. 
Stop, take a breath. They need to catch up. But even 
then living ahead is just a little too hard. When he was going to talk to his crush  he had planned 
it out. Start early and give it time. Even then 32 seconds was too much.
"I think you're amazing, you're funny, clever, thoughtful. I light up when you enter a room and I 
get sad when you leave. I've liked you ever since we met." He timed it perfectly but the second 
after he finished he was
already too far gone. She was about to tell him that she had met someone else. The funny 
thing about knowing the future is that you can't change it. Otherwise, it wouldn't be the future that 
you know. He walked away before she could she finish her sentence. "Childish." He thought to himself now.

He figured out pretty early on free will was a lie. The universe always unfolded exactly how
he knew it would. He even knew that he didn't have a choice. He knew exactly what word he would say 32
seconds from now and as the words left his mouth he knew what the person would say after. Conversations
used to be boring but he learned that the 33rd second was where things got interesting. At the edge of
knowledge where uncertainty lies is where the treasure of potential is buried. As the years went by the 
the treasure got further and further away. 32 seconds of knowledge is enough for a life time when it
starts to stack up. He could learn in half time because he always knew what he needed to know.

It was hard to explain to anyone that asked. People would give him a weird look when he completed their
sentences just a little too early. He tried telling others his friends, partners, one night stands. 
The concept was a bit confusing. It wasn't that he could see the future exactly but that was good enough
approximation. Try telling someone you live life a little ahead and the best they could they do was ask 
if he could guess the number they were thinking of. It became a pick-up line eventually. Even then though
its hard to last with someone when you're not on the same time. Long distance in space is hard, long 
distance in time is almost impossible.

It was unsurprising he would become a writer. He would be on the ending by the time he started. It was 
productive, a way to live out all his fantasies. He would create characters who lived on their time. Like
him they could be different. The world of fiction was under his control unlike the reality around him. 
Unlike everything about him. 

It was a cold morning when he woke up to the sound of the birds. Then there was the screeching and crash. 
He opened the window to see the driver swerve to miss a cat and hit the railings.
