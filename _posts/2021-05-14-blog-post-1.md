In this post I would like to explain why I am starting this blog. This will be an evolving document.

Graduate Student Blog
======
As is tradition in the ML world I will use this blog to explain concepts that I find difficult. Given my 
inability to sustain long periods of attention these posts will seem disorganized and unrelated. I will 
try my best to explain connections where I see them but overall this blog is meant to get my thoughts out.

Topics That Interest me

- Embodied Cognition
- The Philosophy of Biology
- What Cognition Can Tell Us About Politics
