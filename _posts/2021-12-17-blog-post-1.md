I don't know if other people have it figured out yet, but I'm still learning to communicate. 
This blog is practice. I will have hot takes and will be wrong most of the time. Please enjoy.

A Blog of Curiosities
======
Often we think of an expert on a topic as someone who is very knowledgable of a singular (or small
number of) thing(s). We encourage children to pick something to "be" when they grow up. We force students
to pick from a fixed set of classes. We "are" whatever job we happen to be doing at the time. This makes
sense in a world in which efficiency is prized and specialization is rewarded. Being an "expert" 
in this sense is adaptive. In some places though novelty can be just important as efficiency: art and
science are clear examples, although maybe novelty matters in more places than we think.

When novelty is necessary, specialization is a mind-killer. New ideas don't come from nothing.
They are constructed in the moment by combining, comparing, and synthesizing different worlds. 
An expert writer isn't an expert writer because they can write the same sentence over and over again. They
are an expert because they know how to turn an experience into a story. A great programmer isn't a great 
programmer because they know a specific package very well but because they learned how to use any package 
when they need to. I think this is a more accurate representation of expertise. Expertise isn't about knowing
one thing very well but about connecting very many things into something greater than the sum of its parts.

I don't think I am an expert at anything, but I am trying to become one and I'm not sure about what yet. 
In this
blog I want to explore topics as they come up and interest me. I will try to connect them but those connections may
be contrived or circumstantial. I will not have a complete grasp on any of these concepts, but I'll try to make 
my best
arguments. I am always open to discussion or criticism so feel free to reach out if anyone ends up reading this.
