In the orginal formulation of Autopoesis Maturana used the notion of a network of processes as his ontological basis.
That sentence encompasses everthing I love and hate about academia. Autopoesis is an alternative definition of
life that moves beyond the common NASA definition to make life mathematically describable and universal across
different possible planets. It also completely changes how we make sense of free will and life after death. Coolest
of all, it gives us a way to make sense of politics in the context of a planet full of living thinking things.
This post is not about that.

A man never steps into the same river twice because neither the man nor the river are the same again.
This argument dates back at least as far back as philosophy itself. It's the idea that what is 
are not things but processes. Each with its own logic and unfolding. The river is made of many many 
smaller streams that flow together to make something new. They are networked. A network of processes
is a way of thinking about the world that makes it much more interesting.

It turns reality from the stuffy old book of facts into a constant flow of change and opportunity.
Every moment is different than the one before and the one after.
