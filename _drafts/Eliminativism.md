I think we should probably eliminate folk psychology from
our scientific vocabulary. If we're lucky or if we're 
persistent we might even be able to remove it from our 
cultural vocabulary too. 

I am convinced by scientific pluralism. I think the 
proper way to do science is to have a plurality of views 
and perspectives. But the only way that happens is if 
multiple views are propagated and maintained. Folk
psychology forms a barrier to many possible branches
a science of mind could take. Folk psychology forms a
set of theoretical commitments which were made before
we developed our understanding of the world. This means
that many of these commitments are difficult to make sense
of given our "new" ideas. This makes it hard to integrate
pieces of knowledge. This property alone is not the problem.
The second problem is that folk psychology underlies many
many of our existing social, cultural, moral, legal, political,
institutions. Notions of belief, intention, planning all 
play a major role in many structures that govern our lives.
Yet, we cannot make sense of them based on our understanding
of various other phenomena. This should be concerning. Even
if you believe folk psychology is right, the fact that a single
theory for which the empirical evidence is scarce, underlies
so much of our world puts us as a species at risk.

These three sentences are very fucking hard to explain 
scientifically. It seems easy. Hell someone watching me

is none of those are physical. What is a want, a belief, an 
intention?
They are words with many possible physical referents. A want 
could mean anything from
