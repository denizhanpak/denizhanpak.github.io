A rule that I've found helpful over the years: if something comes up in different contexts more than 3 
times it's probably worth learning about. It's a useful rule because it provides a way to look for new ideas 
but it also sets a threshold on my whims. Some ideas though are a little too abstract. They come in many
contexts across many situations but they are hard to spot if you don't already know the language. Process
metaphysics has come up more than 3 times for me. In fact, its come up almost more than any idea I have ever 
encountered. I didn't recognize it until recently and only thanks to some wonderful teachers and brilliant 
colleagues. So if you decide to try out my rule, this post I hope will serve as a motivation to see the world
in a slightly different light.

Boulders Up A Hills
====================
Midway through senior year high school was the peak of my existential angst. I struggled through losing religion
and I was frustrated with a society of strict rules that didn't accommodate for a weirdo like me. Normally, math
was my best subject but senior year English and Philosophy piqued my interest. In both classes and in French
we were exposed to the Existentialists. As a rebellious teen I tended not to read assigned books but this stuff
was interesting. The one I liked the most was Camus. The leather jacket, cigarettes, cool one-liners, and the choice
of the term "Absurd" all had their appeal. However, it was the boulder and hill metaphor that had the biggest impact.
It wasn't subtle, he laid out the philosophy explicitly. The metaphor was there to summarize not to explain but it 
resonated more than anything else. For Camus pushing a boulder up a hill was a metaphor for the meaning of life. Our
constant search for meaning is a pointless task: repetitive and impossible but its not the accomplishment of the task
that gives life meaning. It is the act of pushing the boulder itself which is absurd. In the act of 
searching for meaning is where meaning can actually be found. Meaning is not a fixed object to be discovered or even
created. Meaning is a journey along which the boulder climbs and falls yet we must continue to push on.

My Baby Foot
=================
According to my mom when I was little I asked her after I had just learned about the directions. "Mom if this is my
right foot, whats wrong with this one?" Being the wonderful mother she is she said "nothing at all." That felt like a
lie back then and it felt like a lie for much of my life after. I have three toes on my left foot and a quite a few other
abnormalities. My 14th and last surgery on my left leg was when I was 17 years old. My parents called it my babyfoot 
because it's smaller than my right. A simple reason capitalism sucks is because for the longest time I had to buy two 
different pairs of shoes. 14 surgeries taught me quite a bit. They were painful. They had a special ward for orthopedic 
patients with an Ilizarov frame. The screams were too loud so they kept them from other patients at night. The thing I 
learned about pain is that it's temporary. Time heals all wounds, isn't a very helpful thing to say to someone who's 
suffering (especially if the suffering can be stopped) but it is true. My leg still hurts sometimes, occasionally my
limp is noticed but less frequently. I've learned to ride a bike and with a brace I go rock climbing. Those weren't things
I could do before. It took two decades of medical work, physical therapy, and personal growth to even try new physical 
activities. I used to think my foot was wrong. Instead, I learned that it wasn't wrong it just wasn't where I wanted it 
to be. Both my foot and my relationship to it have changed (are still changing). My foot wasn't wrong because what my foot
is has changed and will continue to until I die and even as I decay after.

A Box of Knowledge
===================
In Cognitive Science we are concerned with a science of knowledge. Knowledge is difficult because in many ways it
