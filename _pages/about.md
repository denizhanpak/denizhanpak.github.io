Research Statement
==========================
When a ball is placed on the top of a hill, it has potential energy. If for some reason the wind blows
a little to hard, an earthquake happens, or a small meteor hits the planet, the ball will roll down
the hill. Based on our understanding of physics this makes perfect sense. Gravity affects all things
and it causes the ball to roll down the hill. The ball does not choose this, in fact the ball does not
"choose" much at all. But when my dog Levi is on top of the hill no matter how much I try to stop her
she will run down before the meteor hits. She too is affect by gravity but its not gravity
that completely determines her motion. Somehow a bunch of electrical impulses in her relatively small
head cause her muscles to contract and release and she outruns any ball I let roll down. We call this
special kind of motion "behavior." Behavior unlike many other kinds of motion isn't governed by a single 
or small number of forces but emerges from the interaction of many smaller kinds of motion. In 
that process we start to call that motion a "choice." I am interested understanding the difference 
between a ball rolling down a hill and behavior. What gives rise to what we call choice? 
Understanding that question means studying at the most fundamental level how motor 
control develops. So in short I am interested in motor learning.

About Me
=========
I am a PhD student in Intelligent/Interactive Systems at Indiana University. My work focuses on the use
of artificial intelligence as a modelling tool for cognition and psychology. I use the mathematical and
computational tools from AI research to build hypothesise of how animal cognition develops. I test those 
hypothesise against the behavior of real animals to falsify them. I then use those results to build
better AI tools and hypothesise thus closing the Theory/Experiment loop that makes science so powerful.

Currently I work in the Building a Mind Lab under my primary advisor Justin Wood. The specific AI tools
we are using currently are "curiosity-motivated" deep reinforcement learning algorithms the animals we
compare them to are baby chicks raised in Virtual Reality (VR) chambers. VR allows us to build a virtual
world which is identical for both the animals and the AI models we compare them too. The advantage being
we can control for nearly all variables in both cases.

Before starting my PhD I was pursuing an MS in Computational Linguistics at Indiana University. During
this time I worked on various projects such as morpheme detection, sentiment analysis, topological data analysis,
word embeddings, and web design.

I did my undergraduate in Mathematics and Computer Science my concentration was on Algebra and AI respectively.
Although I didn't pursue a graduate degree in mathematics I am still deeply interested in the intersection
between mathematics and cognition. Much of my work is about using advanced mathematical tools to understand
systems which have historically been too complex to approach with traditional approaches.
